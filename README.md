Program to build syntactic trees in propositional logic. 
You can drag and move the tree through the blue panel. 
Pink nodes can be expanded by clicking on them.

Syntax of the operators according to precedence order:

- Atoms are any combination of lowercase letters and digits, except the 'v', which is used for disjunction
- Negation is the dash '-'
- Conjunction is the ampersand '&'

- Implication is the dash followed by the grater than symbol '->'

All operators are interpreted as right-associative.
